This code is based off the SparkFun logomatic: 
http://www.sparkfun.com/products/8627

Instructions on how to build are at the Sparkfun link.

Instructions on the actual project of GoldenEmbed are here:

GoldenEmbed is a ANT+ logger. It simply initializes ANT+ channels (HR, Power, 
Speed by default) and logs that data directly to the SD card with a timstamp
that is obtained from the RTC of the logomatic.

In order to parse this data afterwards, a Java application was written called
GoldenEmbedParser https://github.com/jknotzke/GoldenEmbedParser.

This parser will create a .gc file which is a file that is readable by the
Golden Cheetah Project: http://www.goldencheetah.org
