   This is the firmware for the Golden Embed project. Please note that all the code here is under the GPL.

   This firmware runs off Sparkfun's Logomatic: http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=8627 and requires the nRF2401A  http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=153 

   You will also need a LiPo battery, a Mini B 5 pin USB cable and an SD card.

   To get an idea on how to solder the pieces together, see the following: http://www.flickr.com/photos/42018184@N00/sets/72157623403983166/

   To build this firmware you must install either WinARM: http://www.siwawi.arubi.uni-kl.de/avr_projects/arm_projects/ or GnuARM: http://www.gnuarm.com/ for Linux and OS X.

   Once you have the firmware built, simply copy the FW.SFE to a FAT16 formatted (important) SD card loaded in your Logomatic. Then simply pull out the USB cable. This will force the boot loader to load up the firmware.

   The stat lights will blink to indicate that the firmware has started. Then, after a few seconds you should see each stat light blink indicating that it is writing to disk. You obviously need an ANT+ device to be in range.

   The result will be ANT+ messages plus a time stamp tailed to the end of each ANT+ message. To parse this message you may write your own parser or use the Java parser found here: http://github.com/jknotzke/GoldenEmbedParser

   If you have questions, patches there is a mailing list: http://groups.google.com/group/goldenembed
